            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <div class="intro-section">
                <p>My name is Xavier Pezzano, and I am passionate about Computer Science, Game Developent and the Arts. I am studing at the University of New Mexico for my degree in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathmatics. I love to draw, read, and do anything creative during my free time. I also work to improve my devolpmental skills by making games as well as projects on the side when I have time. When it comes to daily life I am extreamly focused on my education and work to improve myself daily by making sure I stay on track as well as staying healthy.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            
            <p>Before coming to collage I had little to no knowledge on the Computer Science or software development as a whole. Due to this lack of knowledge I have had to work harder than those around me to catch up but this hasnt stopped me from improving and excelling. What I do have extensive history and knowledge on is art and design. I have won numerious art contests and awards and have an eye for the design process which I take with me into every project I choose to persue. I belive first looks matter and making sure a project or task being worked on must look pleasing for the viewer. I hope to merge my two intrests with Game Development in the future. Carrer and professional backgrounds I have are working with IT here at UNM as well as working as a student mentor for highschool students entering into collage with ENLACE.</p>

            <h3>Skills and Expertise</h3>

            <div class="skills-grid">
                <div class="skill-card">
                    <h4>Independence & Self-Direction</h4>
                    <p>As a student mentor, I was responsible for creating my own curriculum from scratch and recruiting students for each presentation. This role taught me how to take initiative, plan effectively, and execute projects without constant oversight. Being able to work independently has become one of my strongest assets. Whether I'm tackling a coding project, organizing an event, or learning something new on my own.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-card">
                    <h4>Determination & Adaptability</h4>
                    <p>I didn't come into college with a computer science background, which meant I was starting from square one while many of my peers already had years of experience. Instead of letting that discourage me, I used it as motivation to work harder. I put in extra hours, sought out resources, asked questions, and pushed through the frustration of not understanding something right away. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="skill-card">
                    <h4>Creative Problem-Solving & Design</h4>
                    <p>My background in graphic design and the arts has given me an eye for aesthetics and a natural inclination toward creative thinking. I care about making things not just functional, but visually appealing and thoughtfully designed. Whether it's building a website, creating a presentation, or working on a personal art project, I focus on how things look and feel, not just how they work. I believe that good design matters.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Beyond my technical skills, I pride myself on possessing strong communication skills that enhance my professional relationships and project outcomes. These include effective communication, leadership abilities, time management, and the capacity to work well under pressure.</p>

            </div>

        <div id="education" class="content">
            <h2>Education</h2>
            
            <div class="intro-section">
                <p>My educational journey wasnt allways easy. College forced me to develop real work habits and discipline. I had to figure out time management, how to break down complex problems, and when to ask for help instead of just winging it. It wasn't always smooth, and there were definitely some rough patches, but those struggles taught me more than any easy A ever could. This has changed my outlook on learning as a whole for the better. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="education-item">
                <h4>Bachelor of Science, Computer Science</h4>
                <p class="date">University of New Mexico | 2027</p>
                <p>During my time at the University of New Mexcio, I focused on Computer Science as well as Mathmatics courses. My coursework included challenging classes such as Development of Large Programs as well as various Game Development courses, which equipped me with both theoretical understanding and practical skills applicable to real-world situations.</p>
                <p>Key achievements during this program included passing my Data Organization class which was known to weed out many CS students. I also participated in Game Jams as well as plan to try and enter into a hackathon in the future.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="education-item">
                <h4>CompTIA A+ Certification</h4>
                <p class="date">CompTIA | 2026</p>
                <p>To complement my primary degree, I pursued my A+ certification at CompTIA. This experience allows me to work as a level 1 IT help desk support specialalist aiding me in the tech professional space.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Continuing Education and Professional Development</h3>
            
            <p>I'm currently working toward my computer science degree, and my educational journey has been a mix of challenges, growth, and discovering what I'm truly passionate about. Right now, I'm focused on building a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and understanding new cutting edge technology.

As I continue my studies, I'm actively seeking internship opportunities where I can gain hands-on experience and learn from professionals in the field. I'm also preparing to take my CompTIA A+ certification soon, which I see as an important step in validating my technical skills and opening doors to new opportunities. Beyond internships, I'm exploring apprenticeships and any other learning experiences that will help me grow as a developer and IT professional.</p>

            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            
            <div class="intro-section">
                <p>This portfolio section showcases a selection projects that demonstrate my skills and creativty. Each project represents a unique chllenge that pushed me to grow and learn while also showcasing my enjoyment and passion for my craft. Each choice for my portfolio at this moment starts small and builds up to my my most ambitious project and shows a steady progression of improvment and the scope of my projects increasing with each rendition.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The projects featured here span different areas of my expertise and illustrate my versatility. I will show not only design projects but also technically projects as well as a cobination of both. Each piece tells a story of problem solving, numerous learning experinces and succesful outcomes. I belive these selected in particular best represent my capabilities at this time and will only improve from here.</p>

                    <h4>Noita Inspired Sand Dropper DEMO</h4>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This Project was an assignment for my Intro Into Java class Final this project consisted of making a sand dropper game that had its own physics. For example if placing sand the sand would spread and pile like in the real world, Water would spread and level out, metal would stay put suspended in air manipulating how sand and water would fall. Lastly there was ice that would freeze all water touching it and oil which acted like water but would always float on top of water.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies/Skills:</strong> Required use of  GUI for the interface as well as basic knowledge of Java as well as how to use your development enviorment. A grasp of object oriented programming was extreamly important to making sure elements worked together properly.</p>
                    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> This project may have pushed me the hardest sheerly due to the fact that I had basic no knowledge of software development beforehand, I was pushed to learn and adapt so quickly I know I made some mistakes. This porject game me a firm understanding of the basics of java as well as object oriented programming which helped tremdously in projects and classes moving forward. I would love to revist this project and see how I can improve and make work better in the future.</p>

                    <h4>Othello 2-Player/AI Game</h4>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This Project was an assignment for my Intermediate Java class and was around the middle of the semester and was two players trying to get 5 of their pieces in a row simlar to connect 4 but on a 2D flat grid with extra limitations. I was also in charge of programming an AI opponent if the player chose that made smart decisions. 
                    <p><strong>Technologies/Skills:</strong> Required the use of a GUI to display the game board as well as a strong understanding of the Java fundamentals. I was required to use problem solving skills to code and making an intelligent AI that made moves to win and beat the player.</p>
                    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> This project was hard for a diffrent reason that the Noita Project as it was easy to impliment the rules of the game and point scoring and background actions. The hard part was developing an AI that made moves that were smart, I wasnt allowed to make an AI that just made the next avalible move as that would be too easy, the way I got around this issue was by assigning a point value to pieces that were in a row therefore allowing the AI to know which pieces would get it closer to winning and if the point value of the players color or the AI's color was larger would determine if the AI would block the players next move or advance their own board state.</p>

                    <h4>Kitty Klicker Idle Game</h4>
                    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Lastly this project was my final for Introduction to Game Design and was an Idle, Clicker Game that consisted of clicking a kitty to get currency to buy upgrades that increased your currency more. This would continue until you had enough currency to prestiege and then retart at a faster accelerated pace. All assests were made myself. </p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies/Skills:</strong> This projected required skills in design, conceptuilzing ideas and executing them, grasp on pixel art and required tools, Unity Engine to run my game, as well as learning the C# programming language.</p>
                    <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Saying the Noita Game was the harderst was a mistake this project by far pushed me the most, I was tasked with learning a game engine, learn a new programming language as well learn to deliver good looking pixel art all for this final project. I was pushed the furtherest in this project than in any of my others. Kitty Klicker was my most succesful project and is my prize possession I worked hard for months to have it come out perfectly and It has been the most I've improved. I dont plan to come back to this, but I do have many plans for other video games in the future with bigger scope than Kitty Klicker.</p>

            <h3>Lessons Learned and Growth</h3>
            
            <p>Each project in my portfolio has contributed to my professional growth in meaningful ways. I would not be where I am without these three projects they have shaped and helped me improve in ways I have yet to notice. I would have never learned C# was it not for my game developement class. I also would have never found my love for creating games without my final project which has now shown me there is a path were I can combine my two passions of design and art with software development and mathmatics.</p>

            <p>The projects showcased here represent not just completed work, but ongoing learning experiences that continue to influence how I approach new challenges. When I first made my Noita game it felt like the largest mountain to climb and now it seems like a small hill in comparison now, I hope in a couple years my Kitty Klicker game seems the same way. These projects have helped me improve and shape the scholar I am here at UNM and will continue to stay with me as I learn and develope new projects in the future.
